# Conditionals Lab

Conditionals are a super important tool in your toolbox, as they allow the programs you write to react dynamically to variable circumstances. The challenges outlined in `conditionals.js` will give you numerous examples of where conditionals are necessary.

## The Lab

Open up `conditionals.js` and go through the challenges one at a time. The code associated with each challenge is commented to avoid clogging up your output; so uncomment it first, and then when your code works as expected, comment it again and move on.
